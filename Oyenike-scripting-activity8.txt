# This script prompts a user for a series of 5 - 10 integers
# The user will be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
# After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program allows the user to stop entry or enter another number.
# When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
#	the product of the integers
#	the average of the integers
#	the sum of the integers
#	the min of the integers
#	the max of the integers
# After performing the calculations, the program displays the following to the user:
#	the values the user entered
#	each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value
